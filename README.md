# urban-octo-telegram

In this project i added a title for the webpage and fixed the link for "online reputation managment" to jump to that section when clicked. I then added semantic elements to the html to make the code easier to understand and then i updated the style sheet to reflect the changes. I added alt attributes to the images that needed a description, but added alt attributes with no description to the decorative images. Then I refactored the css file as to simplify the code and eliminate extra lines. Finally i restructured the style sheet to match the HTML file so that it is easier to navigate
